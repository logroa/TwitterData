# TwitterData
Using Tweepy from Python to collect data from Twitter to aggregate and analyze in different ways using Pandas.  

Twitter is a great tool for analyzing public opinion about a certain entity.  Although not entirely accurate, it does provide a relevant idea of the sentiment towards something, at least from certain demographics.  An excellent area to utilize Twitter in this regard is sports.  What I am trying to do here is develop a method for collecting daily activity about a certain entity before standardizing the popularity of that entity using tweets, likes, and retweets, as well as a sentiment scoring for those tweets using NLP.

Viewing this daily data over a long period of time could be very interesting, especially when also mapping critical events.
